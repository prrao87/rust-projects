# Rust in Pieces

Journeys between two worlds: Python üêç and Rust ü¶Ä.

This repo contains the code for an upcoming book series called "Rust in Pieces". The goal is to help Python developers learn Rust by building small projects in Rust that they wouldn't normally have any trouble doing in Python. Each solution starts off with a Python implementation for a specific problem and is accompanied by a Rust implementation that performs the same task.

Rust is a language that's known for its steep learning curve (yet, it's almost universally loved by those who become proficient with it). The book series that builds on this repo aims to make the initial steps for Python developers less daunting by providing a familiar environment for Python developers who are used to solving real world problems in their day-to-day work.

The ultimate goal of this repo is to help developers become proficient enough with data engineering/ops use cases in either language to make an informed choice about whether to use Rust or Python for specific parts of a larger project. This will come from a deeper understanding of Rust's performance benefits, and how to unite Python and Rust code bases via [PyO3](https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3).
