# Rust in Pieces

Journeys between two worlds: Python üêç and Rust ü¶Ä.

This repo contains the code for an upcoming book series called "Rust in Pieces". The goal is to help Python developers learn Rust by building small projects in Rust that they wouldn't normally have any trouble doing in Python. Each solution starts off with a Python implementation for a specific problem and is accompanied by a Rust implementation that performs the same task.

Rust is a language that's known for its steep learning curve (yet, it's almost universally loved by those who become proficient with it). The book series that builds on this repo aims to make the initial steps for Python developers less daunting by providing a familiar environment for Python developers who are used to solving real world problems in their day-to-day work. There won't be any games or toy problems to showcase Rust syntax (there's the rest of the internet for that).
