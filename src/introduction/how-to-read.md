# How to read this book

The pieces are not meant to be read in a specific order. However, they are roughly organized in order of increasing complexity, and each piece, by and large, utilizes concepts that may have been introduced in an earlier piece.

One of the challenges with learning (and teaching) Rust, is that certain concepts such as ownership, borrowing, traits and lifetimes can be quite challenging to grasp for a new learner, but these concepts are ubiquitous in the language, such that they appear all at once. But, because the learning approach provided here is top-down, the best way to get familiar with these concepts is to try and apply them to your own projects, as done in each piece.

As such, we've tried to introduce these concepts in a way that's as gradual as possible, though it's still possible that you may find yourself having to refer to the [Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) or other resources to understand certain concepts from the bottom-up as you go along.
