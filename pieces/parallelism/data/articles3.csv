103459,151908,"Alton Sterling’s son: ’Everyone needs to protest the right way, with peace’",Guardian,Jessica Glenza,2016-07-13,2016.0,7.0,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/13/alton-sterling-son-cameron-protesters-baton-rouge,"The son of a Louisiana man whose father was shot and killed at   range by Baton Rouge police asked protesters for “peace” and “no violence, none whatsoever”. Cameron Sterling, the    son of Alton Sterling, whose death at the hands of police was caught on video, spoke about his father and protests.  Alton Sterling was killed by Baton Rouge police on 5 July at a convenience store, where he was said to be selling CDs. Baton Rouge police said in a statement that police were called to the convenience store because Sterling had allegedly threatened another patron with a gun.  The press conference on Wednesday is Cameron’s first since he broke into sobs at a nationally broadcast press conference with his mother, following his father’s death. “I came to talk to everyone about one: the death of my father. And, two: about how I feel about people in general,” said Cameron, whose distinctly young voice was calm and composed in front of the scrum of reporters at the Triple S convenience store. “People, in general, no matter what the race, should come together as one united family. “No more arguments, violence, crimes,” said Cameron. “Yes, you can protest, but I want everyone to protest the right way. Protest in peace  —   no guns, no drugs, no alcohol, no violence. Everyone needs to protest in the right way, with peace. No violence, none whatsoever. ” Earlier on Wednesday, in an interview with CBS News, Cameron said he didn’t believe all police were “bad” and that all police “shouldn’t be punished for other police’s crimes”. “The police in Dallas, Texas, they didn’t deserve that,” said Cameron. Alton Sterling’s death spurred a Department of Justice investigation, protests across the country, and was one of the subjects of a march in Dallas on Thursday when a gunman attacked and killed five police officers there.  His was the first of two police shootings that week, including a shocking video of the shooting of Minnesota man Philandro Castile, the aftermath of which was broadcast live on Facebook by his girlfriend.

103460,151909,Shakespeare’s first four folios sell at auction for almost £2.5m,Guardian,,2016-05-25,2016.0,5.0,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/may/25/shakespeares-first-four-folios-sell-at-auction-for-almost-25m,"Copies of William Shakespeare’s first four books, dubbed the “Holy Grail of publishing” have sold for almost £2. 5m at auction. Christie’s said they were sold as separate lots on Wednesday but were all bought by an anonymous private American collector. The £2, 479, 000 sale in London included the bard’s first folio, which is widely considered to be the most important literary publication in the English language. The book, published in 1623, contains 36 plays, 18 of which had not appeared in print before. It fetched £1. 87m, well above its   estimate of between £800, 000 and £1. 2m. Christie’s book expert Margaret Ford said it was “exhilarating” to bring the newly recorded book to the public’s attention on the 400th anniversary of the playwright’s death. It was sold along with later editions published in 1632, 1664 and 1685. Ford said: “We are pleased with the results achieved in the sale especially since all four books were acquired by the same private American collector. The universality and timelessness of Shakespeare’s insight into human nature continues to engage and enthral audiences the world over. “Even four centuries after his death, his plays touch and transform lives and continue to be read and performed from Albania to Zambia. ”"
103461,151910,My grandmother’s death saved me from a life of debt,Guardian,Robert Pendry,2016-10-31,2016.0,10.0,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/31/grandmothers-death-saved-me-life-of-debt,"Debt: $20, 000, Source: College, credit cards, Estimated time till debt free: Unclear, From a purely financial standpoint, my grandmother’s death is probably the best thing that has happened to me in my adult life.  My grandmother came from overseas to live with my mother and me when I was in high school, as the ravages of Alzheimer’s left her unable to care for herself. This was a difficult situation for everyone and money became tight. But I did enjoy getting to spend time with my grandmother, who I seldom got to visit while growing up. Some of the fondest memories I have of her are from this time. We would sit together on the sofa and watch her favorite television show  —   Jeopardy!  —   even if she wasn’t exactly sure who I was.  I did well in high school and chose to attend a prestigious (and expensive) private university, far away from home. I had won some scholarship money for my academic merits. Although the amount of debt I would have after graduating was apparent up front, I did not fully understand it. That large figure seemed so abstract at the time, and I refused to let it dampen my excitement about going to college. I set out to earn more than one degree, which cost me more money. Significant surcharges were added to my tuition for taking excessive credit hours, and even larger fees were incurred when enrolling in summer classes I had to take in order to keep up. Thus the waters of debt started to flood higher than they were supposed to.  I delivered pizzas, worked at the library, tutored and worked an array of other   jobs. This did nothing to abate these rising floodwaters, although the extra money did help me manage the several credit card accounts I was forced to open during this time to pay for food, gas, rent and utilities. I graduated in 4. 5 years with two bachelor of science degrees and two minors, along with nearly a quarter of a million dollars in cumulative debt, mostly from student loans. I wouldn’t change any part of my journey. I met some amazing, lifelong friends in college. I received a   education from truly inspirational professors. And I had the opportunity to work in a laboratory and contribute to meaningful scientific research studying Alzheimer’s disease.  I strongly desired to go to graduate school. I wanted to pursue scientific research in the field of neurodegenerative diseases. Unfortunately, this was unfeasible in light of my debt. Graduate students do not typically earn attractive incomes.  It was around this time that my grandmother passed due to complications following her long struggle with Alzheimer’s disease. To be sure it was a sad event, as it always is when a loved one dies. But my grandmother had become chronically bedridden, a frail shell of a human being, unable even to recognize her own daughter  —   my mother  —   toward the end.  The coming of death was, I think, a merciful one: it seems that we should pity the living, not the dead. After it happened, my mother looked as though a weight had fallen off her shoulders. She wasn’t the only one whose burden would be lessened by the loss. After her death, my grandmother’s finances, assets and properties were entrusted to my mother. She liquidated nearly all of it, deciding that the best way of putting it to use was by helping me repay my student loan debt.  This was a massive relief from a suffocating situation. My remaining $20, 000 in credit card debt is manageable, although I do not know when I will be completely free of it. I shudder to think of how my situation would be were it not for my grandmother’s “contribution”. I now work three jobs  —   one   and two    —   in order to manage the remaining debt, along with the expense of living in a major metropolitan area. Despite my two degrees and prior work in scientific research, I earn just above minimum wage working   in a laboratory at a     dollar biomedical research institution.  The pay could be better, but I consider myself very fortunate to still be able to work doing scientific research related to neurodegenerative diseases, a field I remain passionate about for obvious reasons. Which is all a bit ironic considering that Alzheimer’s disease is, indirectly, the only reason I’m not utterly drowning right now."
103462,151911,I feared my life lacked meaning. Cancer pushed me to find some,Guardian,Bradford Frost,2016-11-26,2016.0,11.0,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/26/cancer-diagnosis-existential-life-accomplishments-meaning,"It was late. I was drunk, nearing my 35th birthday this past May, alone in a dank college dorm room, attending my   grad school reunion. The journal entry I wrote that night was just one line: “I’m not the man I want to be. ” As reunion charades go, nothing about my life actually suggested I was off track. I had ambitious public service aspirations worked tenaciously loved fiercely wrote confidently about equal opportunity and the American dream bought into and unabashedly endorsed my adopted hometown of Detroit as the best place in the country to work with meaning and purpose. I’d published a book. I’d supported my wife through cancer, relapse, and now four years of remission. I even ran a marathon. But my journal admission reflected two longstanding personal challenges. First, despite all my accomplishments, I carried a deeply held internal anxiety about being “good enough” to meet my ambitions. Second, I believed my alcohol abuse posed a serious threat to it all. Combined, they exposed my biggest fear: was my life of meaning and purpose as I envisioned it slipping through my fingers? I decided to make a change. After nearly 20 years of various cycles of alcohol abuse, moderation and abstinence, I concluded I would take one last shot at forging a balanced approach to drinking before turning to sobriety. I’d read about a drug called naltrexone, which is a pill that helps mitigate and manage alcohol cravings and abuse. After sporadically trying it over the prior year, I decided to use it every day for the next three months. Change came quickly. Two months in, my weekly consumption had cut in half it would cut in half again by early October. I lost 20 pounds and felt great. In tears, I confided to my wife, “I’ve finally broken through. ”  “I’m so proud of you,” my wife replied. “I’m so grateful you found a path that works. Let’s stick with it. ” That was Monday, 10 October. Two days later, I was diagnosed with stage IV kidney cancer. Less than 15% of people with my diagnosis survive five years. This prompted a swift resolution of my other core challenge: I would no longer allow my anxiety about “living the right way” interfere with being my true self in all dimensions of this life. There would no longer be any distinction between the “representative version” of me online versus living every day with full authenticity. Any other way would be a total waste of time.  I’ve embraced the news as an invitation to be my most honest, vulnerable and wholehearted self. I live every day as fully integrated and courageously as possible. I don’t waver. One key outlet has been a podcast I started with my wife and best friend called Defending Your Life, where we process in real time the unfiltered experience, fears and reality of dealing with stage IV cancer. I write now more directly, less esoterically, about my experience on my blog. Although my opportunities to achieve my public service or other professional goals down the road may now be limited by time or strength, I now know they won’t be hobbled by inauthenticity. Most importantly, I’ve come to recognize that I have lived a life of meaning and purpose. A life rich with love and connection. Some have even generously shared that I’ve lived a life that has inspired others. And, having worked through my demons, I’m able to forgive and be proud of myself too. Of course, what’s scary now is while there is so much to live for, this disease, despite all the science, love and everything else needed to take it on, could very well ultimately beat me. I had surgery in October and am facing upcoming systemic treatments over the next   months, and it remains to be seen whether that will make me one of the  % who achieve a “complete response” or the 94% who end up somewhere else along the kidney cancer progression line. The truth is, we’re all terminal. I could also get hit by a bus tomorrow. Or I could beat the odds and live till I’m 90. But whatever my time left on this earth, I’ll now endeavor forward with some earned resolve. I am the person I want to be. I’m not afraid."
103463,151912,"Texas man serving life sentence innocent of double murder, judge says",Guardian,,2016-08-20,2016.0,8.0,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/20/texas-life-sentence-innocence-dna-richard-bryan-kussmaul,"A central Texas man serving a life sentence for a double murder in 1992 is innocent, as are three codefendants no longer in prison, a state judge has found. Retired district judge George Allen ruled Friday that Richard Bryan Kussmaul, 45, should be free. His three codefendants each received   sentences and have already been released.  DNA evidence not available two decades ago shows the four weren’t involved in the fatal shootings of    Leslie Murphy and    Stephen Neighbors at a home near Moody, south of Waco, Allen said in a   opinion.  Allen’s recommendation now goes to the Texas court of criminal appeals for a final decision. The state’s top criminal appeals court had ordered a hearing held last month to look into the men’s claims they were innocent.  “The evidence just seemed overwhelming, with the DNA evidence having excluded these men from any contact whatsoever with these people,” Kussmaul’s lawyer, David Sheppard, told the Waco  . Allen presided over the trial where Kussmaul was convicted of murder. His three   James Edward Long, Michael Dewayne Shelton and James Wayne Pitts Jr, were convicted of sexual assault. Long and Pitts served 20 years. Shelton was released after 17 years.  At the hearing last month, Long, Shelton and Pitts all testified they gave false testimony against Kussmaul at his trial because a prosecutor promised them probation. They also said their confessions were coerced by a deputy who threatened them with the death penalty. The three said at Kussmaul’s trial in 1994 that he and they raped Murphy before Kussmaul shot the two victims. After they were sentenced to 20 years in prison, each recanted his confession. Kussmaul did not testify at the hearing.  “I was willing to say anything they wanted me to say because I thought I was getting probation and no prison time,” Long said at the July hearing. “I had two small children and I was afraid of going to prison for life or, worse, getting executed. ”  If the court upholds the judge’s opinion and the men’s claims of actual innocence, they each could be eligible for a state payout of $80, 000 for each year in prison.

103464,151914,My dad’s Reagan protests inspire me to stand up to Donald Trump,Guardian,Steven W Thrasher,2016-11-28,2016.0,11.0,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/28/my-dads-reagan-protests-inspire-me-to-stand-up-to-donald-trump,"I have been battling depression and sleeplessness while thinking about how to fight Donald Trump and what his rise means about the United States of America. It is dispiriting that after both modest and substantial gains have been made during the Obama and Black Lives Matter years (on race, gender, political imagination, LGBT rights and healthcare) many stand to be rolled back with a vengeance in the coming months and years. The retrenchment is frightening. And it’s become clear that this fight is going to last for the rest of my life. For advice on how to deal with this, I turned to my late father, Bill Thrasher. He was an air force sergeant who went to night school as an adult to become a high school and community college teacher of US and “Afro American” history. My dad died suddenly, in 2003, while teaching a class full of students a blood clot killed him instantly while he was lecturing about the civil war and the reconstruction. His sudden death broke my heart, but he left me with a road map: the example of a civil rights life well lived, a binder of newspaper clippings from a column he wrote in our local newspaper, and a single audio recording of a monthly radio show in Ventura, California, he hosted called Minority Perspective. That sole episode I have was broadcast on 7 December 1986. It was Pearl Harbor day, and the height of Reagan’s   affair. In it, Dad laments his sadness after the previous month’s election, when California voters   a deeply conservative governor. Here’s a passage which gave me life after Trump was elected:  Conservatism, by its nature, is racism. It’s racism only because conservatism simply means to conserve, to preserve the status quo. And the status quo with respect to minorities, is: “Stay in your place! Remain the same, exactly where you’re at. Be the victims of discrimination! Do not protest. Let the laws stand as they are. Do not enact laws that will try to redress grievances. ” So when the county of Ventura, the state of California, and the United States of America votes to support conservative candidates who represent those viewpoints, it is saying to us, the minorities: “It’s gone too far! You must stay in your place. There will be no more change. You must continue wherever you are at. You will always be on the low end of the pole economically and politically. ” And that is why it is so difficult for Afro Americans to accept the conservatives, no matter who they happen to be, whether they are in the Republican party or the Democratic party. Because conservatism, by its very nature, is racist! It’s  . It’s   American. It’s  . It’s   American. It’s   American. It’s   that isn’t white, Anglo Saxon, Protestant male. Because that group wants to preserve what it has illegally gained and wishes to continue  —   in politics, and in economics. And it will use the political institution to keep their gains, even though they weren’t gained honestly or legally. That’s my objection to conservatism. Conservatism will prevent my children and my grandchildren from fulfilling their destiny as Americans. My children and my grandchildren, as well as I am, as well my father and my grandfather and my   were   citizens and are   citizens, and conservatism wants to keep us as   citizens.  I am not going to accept that! I will spend all of my energies fighting that type of thought, and I urge all minorities  —   not just Afro Americans, but all minorities  —   to resist this. We have to do whatever we can, everywhere, wherever we’re at, in whatever capacity we’re in, to keep the issue alive  —   to keep pushing, to keep probing, to keep challenging, until we have forged our way into the economic and political system, where we have a control our of destiny, and not have to leave it in control of people who are antagonistic toward us, who hate us, who do not want to see us have a share in the American dream. Listening to my father fighting Reaganism, 30 years ago next week, is both depressing and freeing as I think about fighting Trumpism. I feel depressed that the same issues he fought remain so present some three decades later  —   issues that won’t be solved in my lifetime. But I also feel less alone in knowing that I am connected to him  —   and to my ancestors and nieces and nephews  —   in an intergenerational struggle for a better America. Even if the fight doesn’t end with me, I hope to ease the path for those who follow, or at least give the comfort that my father’s words lend me today.  Trump and his ilk will try to say “stay in your place” to all of us who aren’t conservative white men accommodationist white liberals will do so, as well.  Fortunately, I know where (and who) I come from, and I can listen to my dad pushing back on Reaganism to guide me when I feel lost in Trumpland. If you, too, are feeling down about the fight ahead, don’t be afraid to ask your elders for guidance. They might just show the way towards the   road just when you need it most. "
103465,151915,Flatmates of gay Syrian refugee beheaded in Turkey fear they will be next,Guardian,Patrick Kingsley,2016-08-07,2016.0,8.0,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/07/flatmates-of-gay-syrian-refugee-beheaded-in-turkey-fear-they-will-be-next,"Three flatmates of a gay Syrian refugee beheaded in a homophobic attack in Turkey last week fear they face a similar fate, after receiving death threats in the days since his murder. Wisam Sankari, a hospital cleaner, went missing on 25 July after going to meet another gay man in Istanbul. His body was found two days later in a nearby area of Istanbul, his head severed and his battered body only identifiable to his friends by his clothing. A week on, three of his flatmates say they fear being murdered in the same fashion after receiving warnings that the man Sankari met on 25 July wants to kill them too. “There have been people in the street and people on the phone, who said: ‘He will get you next,’” said one of Sankari’s friends, a chef who, like his flatmates, asked to remain anonymous for safety reasons. “There was also a voice message on Facebook. ” In an interview with the Guardian in Sankari’s former room, a cramped lodging he shared with five other people, his friends said he had been in fear during the last months of his life after Turkish officials, UN diplomats and charity workers had proved unable to protect him following a series of homophobic attacks. A Greek appeals board said in June that it considers Turkey safe enough for gay Syrians to be deported to as part of the controversial   migration deal. But Sankari’s friends say his experiences show how dangerous the country is for gay refugees, and unstable for refugees in general. They alleged that in the months before his death, Sankari had: “Do you call this safe?” summarised a second of Sankari’s flatmates, as they listened to their friend’s favourite song and watched a video made in his honour. “We don’t have an organisation to protect us. We want everyone in Europe to understand our situation here for Syrians, especially gays. We’re suffering. ” This was the third brutal attack Sankari had experienced, the flatmate continued. “Five months ago, he was attacked and his head was cut,” he said. “He went to the police, but they didn’t help him. [Another time] he was put in a car and he had to throw himself from it [to survive]. ” Then at 12. 20am on 25 July, he got a call from a Syrian who had recently arrived in Istanbul. “He went to see him, and he never came back. Two days later we heard he was dead. ” Sankari’s murder was one of at least 20 homophobic attacks on Syrian refugees in the past six months, according to an activist who is documenting such incidents. “Turkey is not a safe place, it’s not a   place,” said Hossam, a Syrian who organises a weekly support session for gay refugees in Istanbul, and who asked to be identified only by his first name. “And with the political situation in the country, it’s not getting better. ” More generally, Sankari’s friends said many of his other experiences showed how vulnerable life is for refugees of any sexuality in Turkey. Despite recent legislative changes, the vast majority of the 2. 7 million Syrians in Turkey have no realistic chance of accessing the legal labour market, forcing them to work illegally in exploitative conditions that contravene the UN refugee convention. Sankari was one such case. His latest employers paid him about half the Turkish minimum wage (600 Turkish lira, or £150) for a hospital cleaning job that saw him work seven days a week. If he complained, he risked being fired during previous employment as a waiter at a cafe, he was sacked for asking for time off to recover from illness. “We’re working as animals,” said one of Sankari’s friends, a literature graduate who was a teacher in Syria but now works as a waiter in Turkey. “No one is working at what they studied for. We work here   hours a day. We don’t have a weekend. The Turks want us to work and work and work  —   without money or rights. ” Sankari’s battles with Turkish bureaucracy also highlight the basic logistical challenges Syrians face on a daily basis in Turkey. Sankari struggled to access support from aid groups and officials in Istanbul because he had first registered with the Turkish government in Hatay, a city near the country’s southern borders.  To apply for resettlement in the west, or to secure even basic support from   NGOs, Sankari needed to return to Hatay. But he was scared to do so because of threats he had faced while briefly living there, said Hossam, who had met Sankari at his weekly   session. “He was desperately seeking help but he couldn’t reach anyone,” said Hossam. It is a depressingly familiar situation, the activist added. “During my time with the group, I’ve witnessed a lot of serious threats, a lot of hate crimes, people who have experienced incidents that didn’t necessarily end their life, but [involved] beatings, rape and abuse,” said Hossam. “And those people couldn’t reach places where they felt safe and secure. They had to deal with this on their own. ”  A senior government official said: “We are unable to independently verify the claim that the victim’s plea for assistance was ignored by law enforcement. Obviously, this barbaric attack doesn’t reflect the way Syrian refugees are treated in Turkey, which is the largest host of refugees in the world. We are investigating this incident and will take all necessary steps to bring perpetrators to justice. ” In a statement, the UN refugee agency said it was working to resettle LGBTI refugees currently living in Turkey, and expressed sadness about Sankari’s death. A spokesperson added: “We are very sorry and we would like to express our shock and sadness at this appalling crime. We are looking forward to seeing that investigation of the case by the officials concluded asap and perpetrators are brought to justice. “Syrian refugees in Turkey are given temporary protection by the government of Turkey, which is primarily responsible for their protection in the country. UNHCR does not register or document Syrian refugees in Turkey. ”"
103466,151916,Jaffas and daredevils: life on the world’s steepest street,Guardian,Eleanor Ainge Roy,2016-07-22,2016.0,7.0,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/23/jaffas-and-daredevils-life-on-the-worlds-steepest-street,", Most people take 10 minutes to climb the world’s steepest residential street. But Bindi Bezar, who works in a   gift shop near the bottom, does it in seven. “I have angina and climbing 276 steps is cheaper than going to the gym,” said Bezar. Baldwin Street, located on the north face of Signal Hill in Dunedin, New Zealand, is booming. Since being listed in the Guinness Book of Records for its exhausting 1:3 gradient, it has enjoyed local interest. But now Dunedin is a stopping point for international cruise ships, the street has become the top tourist destination in New Zealand’s oldest city.  In the busy season between October and February, hundreds of tourists visit the street each day, starting at 6am and often continuing until dark  —   which in the summer can be 11pm.  It has also become a hot spot for daredevil sports enthusiasts   who trike, bike and slide down the slope in anything with wheels.  In response, a host of entrepreneurial residents have opened gift shops and food outlets  —   with more permanent infrastructure such as public toilets potentially on the horizon.  Beverley McClay has lived on the street for nine years, and delights in the growing popularity of her home. From her porch, she often watches strangers open her gate, potter around her garden, and occasionally  —   and most unwelcomely  —   relieve themselves in her Corokia hedge.  “I think a lot of tourists don’t know this is a real street, that people actually live here,” she laughs.  “It’s very social, very busy. I often come out in my dressing grown to meet people, and the tourists like to watch me stacking wood, they ask me what I am doing. ” McClay, who lives alone, says the street’s fame has stopped her from becoming lonely as the years go by.  “It makes me feel like I am part of a community here, there’s always someone just outside my door. ” In the past year Baldwin Street has also become a   destination in an unusual social media trend to snap pictures at odd angles, which create the optical illusion of the houses being severely lopsided. The trend has significantly increased visitor numbers  —   especially during the winter season when tourists usually avoided the area because of frost, ice and occasional snow. However, to McClay’s disappointment, people are now tending to drive to the top of the street instead of walking, and preferring to use selfie sticks rather than asking residents to take their picture.  On Friday, the street was crammed with an estimated 15, 000 people for the annual Jaffa race, in which 75, 000 chocolate balls were rolled down the hill. “It’s my busiest day of the year,” said Bezar, who has become particularly fond of the visiting ship’s captains, whose drinks she always serves first.  “I know it’s just a street, but most of the residents here are so friendly, it’s also become a really good way to have a chat to a Kiwi. And  —   it’s free. ”"
103467,151917,NSA contractor arrested for alleged theft of top secret classified information,Guardian,Ewen MacAskill,2016-10-05,2016.0,10.0,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/05/nsa-contractor-arrested-harold-thomas-martin-edward-snowden,"The FBI has arrested a National Security Agency contractor on suspicion of the theft of top secret classified data and documents in an alleged security breach at the same intelligence agency whose spy secrets were exposed by Edward Snowden. Disclosure of the documents stolen “could be expected to cause exceptionally grave damage to the national security of the US” claimed the justice department in a press release giving details of the criminal complaint against Harold Thomas Martin III, 51, of Glen Burnie, Maryland. He was charged with theft of government property and unauthorized removal and retention of classified materials by a government employee or contractor, and, it emerged on Wednesday, has been in detention since a court appearance on 29 August.  Details of the arrest were first reported by the New York Times, which suggested the breach involved the possible theft of highly classified computer code developed to hack into the networks of foreign governments. “There is no evidence that Hal Martin intended to betray his country,” said Martin’s attorneys Jim Wyda and Deborah Boardman in a statement, according to the Washington Post. “What we do know is that Hal Martin loves his family and his country. He served honorably in the United States Navy as a lieutenant and he has devoted his entire career to protecting his country. We look forward to defending Hal Martin in court. ” They said the charges against Martin were “mere allegations” and they had not yet seen prosecutors’ evidence.  The justice department confirmed that Martin worked for the same company as Snowden when he exposed details of NSA mass surveillance methods three years ago. Martin has been in custody since a court appearance in August. According to the New York Times, Martin is suspected of taking the “source code” developed by the agency to break into computer systems of adversaries like Russia, China, Iran and North Korea.  Snowden, who remains in exile in Russia, facing charges under the Espionage Act, reacted to the details of the arrest, tweeting to his 2. 4 million followers: “This is huge. Did the FBI secretly arrest the person behind the reports NSA sat on huge flaws in US products?” The White House said Barack Obama took the national security implications seriously. Press secretary Josh Earnest told a briefing: “I think any time that information like this is released in the context of a criminal complaint, the federal government is reminded of how important is it to be vigilant about protecting the national security of the country and information that is relevant to our national security. “So this is certainly a situation that the Department of Justice takes seriously, as evidenced by their complaint, but this is a situation that President Obama takes quite seriously, and it is a good reminder for all of us with security clearances about how important is it for us to protect sensitive national security information. ” The justice department confirmed: “A criminal complaint has been filed charging Harold Thomas Martin III, 51, of Glen Burnie, Maryland, with theft of government property and unauthorized removal and retention of classified materials by a government employee or contractor. ” The assistant attorney general for national security, John Carlin, US attorney Rod Rosenstein for the District of Maryland and special agent in charge Gordon Johnson of the FBI’s Baltimore field office made the announcement. According to the affidavit, Martin was a contractor with the federal government and had a top secret national security clearance. He was arrested late on 27 August as search warrants were executed at his home, two storage sheds and his vehicle on a leafy suburban street outside of Baltimore. “I heard a boom and went to the ground,” Dave Cunningham, who lives a couple of doors down from Martin and described himself as a “lifer” in the neighborhood, said of the raid on Martin’s home. He said he thought it was a gunshot. But when he looked out the window, he saw numerous law enforcement vehicles, including two large vans that parked in front of the house. Glen Bond, who has lived in a house across the street from Bond for 50 years, said there were two big vans in front of the house blocking it from view and “25 or 30 cars”. “They were in camouflaged uniforms, two dozen of them. They were serious. Helmets, rifles,” Murray Bennett, who lives next door to Martin, said. “Big guns,” Bond said. “When they came they took out a whole bunch of stuff but it was all in black trash bags. You couldn’t see anything. ” A woman who came to the door of Martin’s home said: “This is a matter that’s under investigation. I have no comment . .. I’d appreciate it if you’d leave from the front of my house so my dogs will calm down and I can get some peace. ” Neighbors describe Martin and the woman he lives with  —   no one could say whether they were married  —   as “nice” “decent” and “peaceful”. During execution of the warrants, investigators found   documents and digital information stored on various devices and removable digital media. “A large percentage of the materials recovered from Martin’s residence and vehicle bore markings indicating that they were property of the US government and contained highly classified information, including Top Secret and Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI). In addition, investigators located property of the US government with an aggregate value in excess of $1, 000, which Martin allegedly stole,” a justice department press statement said. Martin is said to have had six classified documents obtained from sensitive intelligence and produced by a government agency in 2014. “These documents were produced through sensitive government sources, methods and capabilities, which are critical to a wide variety of national security issues. The disclosure of the documents would reveal those sensitive sources, methods and capabilities,” the justice department said. The documents have been reviewed by a government agency and designated as top secret, “meaning that unauthorized disclosure reasonably could be expected to cause exceptionally grave damage to the national security of the US” the justice department statement said. If convicted, Martin faces a maximum sentence of one year in prison for the unauthorized removal and retention of classified materials and 10 years in prison for theft of government property. An initial appearance was held for Martin in US district court in Baltimore on 29 August and he is still detained. The arrest is a major embarrassment for the NSA and its contractor Booz Allen coming just three years after Snowden, who worked for both. The NSA said in the wake of the Snowden revelations in 2013 it had tightened up internal security, introducing more stringent monitoring of staff and a   system in which sensitive information needed two people to access it rather than just one. Highly classified information would no longer be concentrated in one place, making it harder for potential hackers. The new breach provides fresh arguments for privacy activists who argue that the NSA cannot be trusted to protect all the personal data it gathers, from bank accounts to health records. Supporters of Snowden quickly made a distinction between him and the motives of the arrested man. They reiterated that Snowden is a whistleblower who leaked top secret material out of principle, believing the NSA was acting unconstitutionally by engaging in mass surveillance. It was not yet clear what motivated the latest alleged leaker. Snowden, who had worked for the CIA and the NSA, handed over material to journalists at the Guardian in 2013 when he was employed by Booz Allen as contractor to the NSA. As a computer specialist based in Hawaii, he was engaged in a number of operations, including targeting China. Flying from Hawaii, where he was based, to Hong Kong, he gave tens of thousands of top secret documents to journalists to illustrate the scale of surveillance by the NSA and Britain’s GCHQ. The documents also revealed the extent to which major US tech companies were cooperating with the NSA in providing details from customer accounts. Glenn Greenwald, one of the journalists who was given material by Snowden, rounded on the NSA for its lack of security. “Nobody is more inept at securing its own data than NSA. But trust them to keep all yours safe and secure. ” Jesselyn Radack, a US lawyer who represents whistleblowers, was among those quick to caution journalists about making comparisons with Snowden. In a tweet, she wrote: “Mediapls stop comparing theft of NSA source code to @Snowden blowing whistle on secret domestic surveillance. ”"
103468,151918,Donald Trump to dissolve his charitable foundation after mounting complaints,Guardian,Ben Jacobs,2016-12-24,2016.0,12.0,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/24/trump-university-shut-down-conflict-of-interest,"Donald Trump announced on Saturday that he will shut down his charitable foundation, a response to mounting complaints over conflicts related to the  ’s charitable and business interests. In a statement released by his campaign, Trump said the Donald J Trump Foundation would be “dissolved” to avoid “even the appearance of any conflict with my role as President”. Trump said he would continue to pursue his “strong interest in philanthropy” in other ways. The closure of the Trump Foundation, which was first reported by the New York Times, requires the approval of the New York attorney general’s office, which is currently investigating the nonprofit and issued a cease and desist order to it in October. The Donald J Trump Foundation was repeatedly the subject of controversy throughout the presidential campaign after a series of investigations by the Washington Post’s David Fahrenthold. Trump reportedly used $258, 000 of the foundation’s money to pay for personal legal settlements. He also spent charitable funds on multiple portraits of himself and on a football helmet autographed by Heisman Trophy winner Tim Tebow. The foundation also made a donation to a political group supporting Florida attorney general Pam Bondi, a longtime Trump backer in violation of tax law. The   has since paid $2, 500 to the Internal Revenue Service over the donation. Trump had not donated to his own foundation since 2008 the nonprofit relied on donations from other Trump associates, including professional wrestling magnates Vince and Linda McMahon, who gave $5m to the Trump Foundation. Linda McMahon has since been announced as Trump’s nominee to lead the Small Business Administration. The decision also comes as Trump’s children have been under scrutiny for charitable efforts that raised questions over whether people were paying for access to the incoming president and his family.  A celebrity auction for a coffee date with Ivanka Trump, sponsored by Eric Trump’s charity, was called off earlier in December because donors were apparently given an attempt to curry favor with the incoming president and buy access to one of his closest advisers. Both Eric and his brother, Don Jr, were also scheduled to appear at a reception on behalf of conservation charities over the weekend of the inauguration. The reception, which has since been canceled, reportedly promised the opportunity to meet the   in exchange for $1m in donations. These issues have come as Trump’s entire real estate business has come under scrutiny for potential conflicts of interest. In particular, Trump’s international properties have the potential to violate the emoluments clause of the constitution, which prohibits anyone holding “an office of profit or trust” from accepting “any present, emolument, office, or title, of any kind whatever, from any king, prince or foreign state”. But these conflicts also apply domestically, as the Kuwaiti government has already announced that it is shifting its annual party in February to Trump’s new hotel in Washington. The issues are further amplified because the Trump Organization is a privately held corporation and the   has flouted longstanding tradition in not releasing his tax returns. The result is that there is no clear way to know what assets and liabilities Trump has. It is known, though, that Trump owes $364m to Deutsche Bank. A news conference that the   promised to hold on the topic on 15 December has since been postponed until sometime in January 2017."
